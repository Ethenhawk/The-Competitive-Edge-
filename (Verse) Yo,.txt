(Verse)
Yo, trust is a bitch, yeah it cuts like a knife,
Got you lookin' over shoulders, man, that's just life,
Friends turn to foes, it’s a dangerous ride,
Gave my heart to the game, now I'm fightin' to survive.


Keep my circle tight, know the snakes in disguise,
Loyalty’s a treasure, but betrayal’s on the rise,
Thought I had a team, but the envy’s run deep,
Trust is a myth, now I'm countin' my sheep.


Life's a gamble, roll the dice, then you fly,
But when the trust is gone, that’s when you really die.
Heartbreak in the verses, pain in every line,
Still I rise from the ashes, watch me redefine.
